# PSoP, the Discord Chatbot
The public "Pokemon Smash or Pass" Github repository, this was made in 2 days as a fun project. It uses beautifulsoup. 

If you are looking forward on using the bot, note that this isnt supported for newer pokemons, so you will have to dig trough the code to find out the hardcoded max pokemon number on the definitions and other places like that.

Enjoy!

## How to use for yourself?
```
Step 1: Download the repository files using the "CODE" tab and clicking on "Download ZIP".
Step 2: Create a folder and extract the ZIP inside.
Step 3: Build your own bot on the discord developer portal, and grab the BOT TOKEN.
Step 4: Invite the bot to your server using the OAUTH generator.
Step 5: Navigate to the last line in the file "main.py" and replace the string with your token.
Step 6: Run main.py and have fun!
```
