# PSoP
The public PSoP Github repository, this was made in 2 days as a fun project.
If you are looking forward on using the bot, change the bot token on the last line to your own bot token. By the way, this isnt supported for newer pokemons, so you will have to dig trough the code to find out the hardcoded max pokemon number.
Enjoy!
